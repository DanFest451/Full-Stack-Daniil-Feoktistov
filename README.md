# Project
This project is a fully functional web application that allows users to collaboratively create, edit, share, and manage documents. The system is built using JavaScript/TypeScript technologies and has a clear separation between frontend and backend.
Backend: TypeScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB and Mongoose, JWT authentication and file uploads.
Frontend: TypeScript, React, Vite, i18n for internationalization (4 languages: English, Finnish, Russian and Spanish), CSS and a little bit HTML.

# Installation
When downloading files, it is important to download everything and install it in a specific structure! Also, it's too important to create an empty folder under Backend.
Setup process: In terminal user writes cd Backend or Frontend, then npm install and npm run dev.
An example: npm install i18next react-i18next (Usually, it's enough to write only "npm install")
